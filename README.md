# Naive Torrent

This is a simple BitTorrent client written in Ruby. It implements a part of the protocol natively without relying on external libraries like `libtorrent`. It's a toy project and it's not targeted at any actual use cases.

# Usage

Install it as a gem:
`gem install naive_torrent`

`naive_torrent start path/to/torrent_file.torrent`
